 This product is related to a computer vision task and exhibits a pipeline of deep neural networks that allows the detection and execution of movements in various environments. One of the main aspirations is to detect real-time gestures performed by users (for instance, scale, swipe, minimize) and execute this action, for example, on the user's computer.
